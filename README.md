# One-Class-Classification-based-on-Adversarial-Learning

This work's idea is come from ALOCC from https://github.com/khalooei/ALOCC-CVPR2018 but it change the CNN to ANN due to I want this work to support signal processing. Moreover, I apply the pca before put into network for reduce dimensionality reduction and after the network, I apply the 2 clustering KMean for separate into 2 classes. 

For using, put your own dataset into the code and run. 
Note that, the code is not well organize.
